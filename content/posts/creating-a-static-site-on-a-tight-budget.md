title: Creating a static site on a tight budget
---

If you are on a tight budget, and want to create a static site on a custom domain, your in luck. If your hosting a static site on a tight budget, I highly recommend something like Netlify. You can drag and drop your static site code or connect to Github repo.

### &#xA;How?

Just create Github repo for website folder with Github desktop, or drag and drop folder into Netlify Deploys page. I recommend pushing code to Github and deploying that way.

### Why not just use a page builder?

Page builders tend to cost more and can add up quickly. Take Webflows pricing for example:

May not seem that bad, but it adds up quickly, trust me. Anyway, just code sites yourself. Its wayyy cheaper, and you get full control.
